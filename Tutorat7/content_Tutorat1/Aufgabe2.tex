\begin{frame}{Task 2}{Design space exploration}
    \begin{tasknoinc}
        Consider again the sequence graph and the speciﬁcation of task 1. Assume that there is only one resource type which can compute all operations $(+, -, <, *)$ and has an area of 1. The cost of an implementation is given by the total required area. The goal is to ﬁnd the Pareto-points of the design space which is given by the parameters cost and latency. The number of allocated resources is not yet ﬁxed.
        \bigskip

        Compute a lower and an upper bound for the latency in order to limit the possible Pareto-points.

    \begin{solution}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The latency bounds are easily determined by considering the sequence graph of exercise 1.
            \item We have seen, that we can achieve a Latency of $L = 11$ with just one resource. Hence $L \leq 11$.
            \item We have also seen that with an unlimited amount of resources, the best we can achieve is $L = 4$ since the dependencies won't allow us to go any faster, no matter how many ressources we can use to distribute operations on. Hence $L \geq 4$
            \item Thus, the bounds for $L$ are: $4 \leq L \leq 11$
        \end{itemize}
    \end{solution}

        Compute a lower and an upper bound for the cost in order to limit the possible Pareto-points.

\begin{frame}{Task 2}{Design Space Exploration}
    \begin{solution}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The costs are determined by the area, that is, in this case, the amount of resources we use. Our lower and upper bound for $L$ helps us to find the bounds for $c$ more quickly.
            \item In the slowest case, we had $L = 11$ with just one resource, hence $c \geq 1$
            \item In the fastest case, we had $L = 4$ with unlimited resources. What finite number of resources are necessary, to achieve the same latency?
            \item [$\Rightarrow$] An easy to see upper bound to reach the lowest latency is $c = 5$. However, it's possible to reduce the resources even further to obtain $c \leq 3$.

\begin{frame}{Task 2}{Design space exploration}
    \begin{solutionnoinc}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item First we have to consider the set of all possible solutions $(L, c)$. Our lower and upper bounds help us to vastly reduce the amount of solutions that we have to consider.
            \item For each c $\in \{1, 2, 3\}$ we determine the fitting latency L and obtain:
            \item [] Solution 1: $(11, 1)$
            \item [] Solution 2: $(6, 2)$
            \item [] Solution 3: $(4, 3)$
            \item Out of these solutions, we now determine the Pareto-optimal front.
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{requirementsnoinc}
     A solution $a \in X$ weakly Pareto-dominates a solution $b \in X$ denoted as $a \preceq b$, if it is as least as good in all objectives, i.e. $f_i(a) \leq f_i(b)$ for all $1 \leq i \leq n$. Solution a is \alert{better} than b, denoted as $a \prec b$, iff $(a \preceq b) \land (b \npreceq a)$.
    \end{requirementsnoinc}
    \begin{solutionnoinc}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Looking at out three solutions $(11, 1), (6, 2), (4, 3)$ it is clear that according to the above definition, no solution is \alert{better} than the other. Meaning, we already have found the Pareto-optimal front!
        \end{itemize}

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Task 2}{Design space exploration}
    \begin{Sidenote}
    If we had chosen $1 \leq c \leq 5$, the solutions would have been $(11, 1), (6, 2), (4, 3), (4, 4), (4,5)$. It is obvious, that $(4, 3) \preceq (4, 4)$ and $(4, 3) \preceq (4, 5)$ but not the other way around. Hence the last two solutions are inferior compared to $(4, 3)$ and can be removed from the set of solutions. As conclusion, finding a tighter bound helps us to immediately reduce the solution space we have to explore. Though, it might not always be so easy to find these bounds in the general case.
